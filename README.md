## Hey there!
------------
My name is Marcus, and I am a game developer on Roblox. I have contributed to numerous titles such as [Horse Valley](https://www.roblox.com/games/2830250344/Horse-Valley-BETA), [Pick A Side](https://www.roblox.com/games/663655429/Pick-A-Side), [Egg Farm Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1828509885/AUTO-EGGS-Egg-Farm-Simulator), [Building Architect](https://www.roblox.com/games/5857383913/ITALY-Building-Architect)
...[and 8 more](https://www.roblox.com/users/97718174/favorites#!/places). 


Recently, I have dipped into the open-source space and it has been such a fun experience. I was scavenging around to look for open-sourced games for Roblox and there are quite a few :sweat_smile:.

The problem here is that most of these games have been abandoned, outdated or for other reasons no longer maintained. They are great resources to learn from but that is not quite what I was looking for. 

A lot of people of seek to create something *together*, making experiences as a community. Hence why I have started this [project](https://github.com/Ukendio/Game) which is essentially a blank canvas that anyone can contribute to at anytime no matter **your identity**. 

My main motivation for this is to see how far we as an open-ended community can accomplish together.
